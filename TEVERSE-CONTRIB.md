# Contributions

Everyone is welcome to contribute to Teverse. For Teverse to truly be for developers, we strongly encourage developers to take part in its development. Whether you're here to suggest, find bugs or build the next component to workshop, those efforts mean a lot to us and the community that we foster. 

# Issues

Issues are a core component of development and help identify pitfalls (or improvement) in our design. Whether you're replying to a edge-case or helping to isolate the root cause of a bug, developers can benefit from the knowledge and expertise you bring. 

We prefer that all feature requests and bug reports are to be redirected to our [Forum](https://forum.teverse.com) but, if you don't have an account (a teverse account is needed to post), feel free to open up an issue. 

# Reporting

Reporting, suggesting features and feedback are essential to help improve Teverse. However, we ask that all reports (including issues) are to follow our format and guidelines. 

> If a bug is breaking your workflow and causing serious issues for you and other developers, please label the issue under **Incident Reports** under the [Forum](https://forum.teverse.com) or **Critical** in the title of an opened issue. 

When reporting, please include the following format:

* **Descriptive Title** - a title that explains the bug in simple terms; no full sentences

* **Version of Teverse** - the version that the bug started to become noticeable 

* **Operating System Name & Version** - i.e. MacOS Catalina 10.15.1  

* **Detailed Description** - a description of the bug in full detail 

* **Issues caused by the the bug** - development setbacks, workflow disruption, etc 

* **Steps that were tried to correct beforehand** - Steps you have taken in an effort to correct the issue.

> **Note:** If any information is missing or unknown, please leave an ``n/a`` for that section. Please do not skip or occlude the entire section. 

> **Note:** If you do not follow the format above, it will be rejected and sent back to be corrected.

Teverse is under active development and bugs can be introduced or fixed by mistake. If this does occur, we'll let you know before closing your issue. If the issue is misplaced, please contact a staff member to reopen. If the issue is a duplicate, we'll refer you to the most recent related issue to prevent clutter.

# Contributing Code

Contributions in the form of new features, upgrading current features or fixing a bug is always welcome and we encourage the community to participate in the development of our platform. To keep this process streamlined, we ask that you follow the following format:

# Code Review

Once you've submitted a pull request and it's properly formatted, it will go through code review to verify accurate, efficiency and software quality / integrity. 

* Code Reviews are conducted through Github comments and not our Forum

* All changes that have been pushed by the reviewer must be changed accordingly; we're not responsible for making changes, you are

We'll let you know what needs to be changed and you can request a reviewer to review your code whenever plausible. 

> **Note:** Code Review can be an extensive process if our procedure is not followed or we get an influx of pull requests, please be patient
